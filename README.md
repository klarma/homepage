## Description

The website about me is to consolidate and supplement my acquired skills in the field of HTML, CSS, JS. The [youcode course](https://youcode.pl/frontend-developer/) is the basis on which the project was created. It gives me an opportunity to systematize knowledge, implement current solutions, be proficient with the most desirable Front-End practices and conventions used by experienced developers around the world**. The page about me is not just simple but it also strongly aims to show the use of proper practices, which will facilitate the implementation of my skills as a Junior Front-End Developer.

The creator of the course [Krzysztof Dąbrowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dabrowskisoftware), an experienced Senior Software Engineer  looks after the correctness of my work.
